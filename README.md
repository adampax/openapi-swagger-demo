# openapi-swagger-demo
Demonstrating the use of OpenAPI Spec and Swagger tools to build REST APIs, documentation, and generated SDKs


# Contents

## API

Contains a sample api generated by swagger-node

To Run:

```
[sudo] npm install -g swagger
swagger project start api
````

To Start OpenAPI Doc Editor:

`swagger project edit api`

Sample Query:

`curl http://localhost:10010/lyrics?name=Paul`

## Codegen

Contains a compiled version of the codegen cli, as well as a sample install script for generating a typescript client library for our lyrics api.

Note: You'll need to have the api running before building the client library, as it will fetch the swagger info from `http://localhost:10010/swagger`.

Generate a TypeScript Library:

`./codegen/gen-typescrpt.sh`

## ng-demo
Contains an Angular demo app that uses the codegen generated client library to connect to our api.

```
[sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
cd ng-demo
ng serve --open
```
